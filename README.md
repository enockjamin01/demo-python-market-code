This is a project I did during my 1st Sem of my Computer Science engineering degree (2020) and I am currently in my 5th Sem this was a fun project. I just got this project file when I was surfing through my Finder and Decided to Upgrade this project with all the skill I will learn and Thought that this would also help people who are learning these technologies.

# Version 0.1

This version of the project is made using only python and can be just downloaded and can be directly ran in any local machine as its just raw python code this version can help you understand a lot about Variables,Loops,Functions,Condition statements and OOPS using Classes and Objects in Python.
